The team is currently playing in the Liga II. The history of football from Miercurea Ciuc (Csíkszereda) started back in 1904, when Transylvania was still part of Austria-Hungary and the football club of the city was an amateur one, without significant results at the national level. Re-founded as Asociația de Educație Fizică din Miercurea Ciuc in 1919, and after as part of Romania until 1940, when re-annexed to Hungary it was renamed as Csíkszereda TE, the club did not obtain important results, the maximum being a season (interrupted after 4 rounds) in the Nemzeti Bajnokság II, second league of Hungary. After WWII Miercurea Ciuc has become again part of the Kingdom of Romania then from 1947 of the Socialist Republic of Romania and football has taken a downward slope until 1971, when AS Miercurea Ciuc (as it was named at that time) promoted for the first time in its history in the Divizia C. During the 1970s and 1980s, the team evolved mainly in the third tier, under names such as IUPS, Tractorul or Rapid, having as the best performance a 3rd place at the end of the 1988–89 season of Divizia C. After the Romanian Revolution of 1989 Rapid has encountered many financial problems, promoting and relegating constantly between the third and fourth tier, all culminating in a withdrew from the championship of Divizia C at the start of the 2000–01 season. After a decade of amateurism and subsistence, the football club of Miercurea Ciuc was re-founded in 2010 under the name of CSM Miercurea Ciuc (Hungarian: VSK Csíkszereda), changing its name after two years in FK Miercurea Ciuc (Hungarian: FK Csíkszereda). The team won Harghita Series of Liga IV in 2012, 2013 and 2014, before promoting back to Liga III, after 14 years of absence. In the third tier, under the led of Róbert Ilyés, the squad beat the old record of the club and finished 2nd at the end of the 2017–18 edition. Finally, at the end of the 2018–19 season, under the command of Valentin Suciu, the coach who promoted Sepsi OSK Sfântu Gheorghe (first team from Székely Land that achieved the top-flight of the Romanian football) from the fourth tier to Liga I, ""the Red and Blacks"" promoted for the first time in their history to Liga II.",1448597,Miercurea Ciuc
